                    XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; started off as an "experimental code doodle" from Micheal Houghton. It allowed read-only access
                    to a DOM tree representing an XML string.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While looking for a JavaScript parser during the Summer of 2000, I ran across XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
                    and used it for a large web-based application that I was developing. During the development of that application, I was impressed
                    with how useful the library actually was. My next web application was a custom XML-based content management system.
                    Since the back end employed XML as its data source, it was an easy decision to use XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; on the client side as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the successful implementation of the content management system, I decided to volunteer to maintain XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt;. Michael
                    was gracious enough to allow it, and I set forth to merge my DOM manipulation code into his tree and build a web site to support the project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In early Summer 2001, I released XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; 1.0. Since then, thousands of people have downloaded the project. Many
                    have emailed me with suggestions and compliments. I have exchanged greetings with people all over the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've also received patches and code contributions. Scott Severtson created the SAX parser and test suite included with XML for
                    &lt;SCRIPT&gt; version 2.0. He also created a new XML parser that will be the base for future enhancements to the project.
                    Raymond Irving helped considerably by creating and documenting the SAX parser examples as well as coming up with the
                    why-didn't-I-think-of-that-idea for the xmlPack functions. A great deal of thanks is also due to Jennifer Sims, who redesigned the
                    website around XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; to make it look wonderful and considerably more professional than the one I originally crafted.
                </p>

                <p>
                Thanks to everyone who's contributed so far!
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's in the future? Well, Scott's work on the SAX parser also resulted in a potentially more robust, standards complient and faster DOM implementation
                    as well as some other goodies. Many people are trying to use XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; in off-line mode and are requesting some way
                    to save XML data to the file system. Plans are in the works to create a Java Applet that can be signed so that XML data can be stored
                    and retreived in a cross-platform manner. A volunteer in this area would be very much appreciated. Also, wouldn't it be cool if we could
                    have an XSL/XSLT engine as well? As always, your ideas and suggestions (as well as contributions) are very welcome!
                </p>

                    return a list of attribute names (Direct access to the attributes array property is discouraged)

                    As a result, the .js files are renamed to more appropriately describe their function. In addition, a new web site
                    design is introduced that makes the distribution look considerably more professional and easier to read.

                    I would like to personally thank Michael Houghton &lt;mike@idle.org&gt;, the original author of XML
                    for &lt;SCRIPT&gt;. Without his original work, this parser would never have come into being.

                    could provide the smallest chunk of XML that demonstrates the problem.
